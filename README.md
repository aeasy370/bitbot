# bitbot
simple coin base API program that trades bitcoin algorithmically based on prices.

Trading systems relies on secondary file known as "phrase.py" to log into coin base api. An account will be required and by default the script is 
designed to work in the sandbox rather than the main coinbase website. By creating a sandbox api and filling in your own logins for the api you too can trade with this bot.
